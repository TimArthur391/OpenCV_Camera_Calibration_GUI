# OpenCV_Camera_Calibration_GUI

This was to be used as a teaching exercise in git, github, tkinter, and object oriented coding.

This repository, when ran, should open a GUI that allows a images to be selected to run a camera calibration. Then another to allow for images from that camera to be 'flattened'
